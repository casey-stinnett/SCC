# The Secret to Success in Programming

### Rather, the secret to success in anything great

---

# Nobody great became great without a mentor.

### Bill Gates was mentored by Warren Buffett

### Mark Zuckerburg was mentored by Steve Jobs

### Oprah Winfrey was mentored by Maya Angelou

### Mother Theresa was mentored by Father Michael van der Peet

---

# Everybody great had a mentor

### Let me serve as that mentor for you. 

Remember two things that will keep you successful:

1 - Asking questions of someone who knows what you want to know

2 - Persevere through the hard times

---

# The goal is to learn to learn

### The goal isn't to learn programming, it's to learn how to learn so that you can learn more even after the class is through
