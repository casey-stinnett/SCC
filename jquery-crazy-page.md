# To get better, you must do

Sometimes, to learn web development better, you just have to make a mess of things. We know, your mom told you not to. But your mom isn't here and we're giving you permission to make the mess! We'll take the blame. :D

# Your assignment is to make a crazy page

You want this page to blow your mind a little.
It should have the following features:

  - When you click a button, a box flies across the screen and then returns
  - When you type while anywhere on the page, the letter you pushed shows up somewhere on the page
  - Create an element that when you double click on it, it should change to a random color from an array of colors you create
  - Every 22 seconds an image should show up full screen and then disappear after half a second
  - 2 crazy happenings of your choice. Make it fun! The sky is the limit.
