# [fit] The Next 2 || 4 Weeks

* **Week 1**: HTML/CSS -> Personal Website
* **Week 2**: JS/jQuery -> Budgetr
* **Week 3**: Making Movin' and Groovin' Look Good
* **Week 4**: Finalizing Your jQuery, Bootstrap, and Styling Skills

---

# Week 1: HTML/CSS -> Personal Website

### Time to get settled in and get yourself organized

- Start finding resources on your own
- Build your study habits
- Create study groups with classmates
- Establish some healthy sleep habits
- Be prepared to work

---

### Today is the day to clear your calendar of all events for the next 2(4) weeks. You will be studying and working late into the evenings, and weekends will be full of code. You'll be out of the social spotlight for a while, but it will all be worth it!

# Week 2: JS/jQuery -> Budgetr

### All JavaScript, all the time!

We'll dive head first into programming with JavaScript. You'll build your skills with the fundamentals, then move into making it simpler with jQuery. There will be plenty of homework and workshops to stretch those programming muscles.

---

### Extra effort is crucial. It is deceptively easy to fall behind. Don't let that happen! Stay late and find a study buddy. Slack and Google are your new best friends. Binge watch tutorials instead of Netflix.

---

# At the end of these 2 weeks, you will walk away with a fully functional budgeting website.
#### If you are going to leave us now, that's fine. You still have a solid foundation.
#### If you are going to stay the remaining two weeks, then look on!

---

# Week 3: Making Movin' and Groovin' Look Good

### Make your Budgetr app interactive and responsive

You Budgetr app is pretty sweet by this point. But it is lacking a few things.
It needs tobe responsive, you'll need to be able to add & remove categories, and you'll need to sort them!
You will do that this week.

---

# Week 4: Finalizing Your jQuery, Bootstrap, and Styling Skills

### Finish him!

The goal this week is to get that Budgetr app fully functional, interactive, and impressive. 
This is your time to *shine* and make yours stand out. Make your wildest dreams come true here because the sky is the limit.

# Attendance

### Maintain an attendance grade of 80% or higher *at all times*, including the last day of class.

You must be in your seat and prepared before class starts at **10AM**, and stay until class ends at **6PM**.

**If you have to be late**, you are responsible for looking at the day's slides and other students' notes to see what you missed.

**If you are done before the end of the day**, find a tutorial to watch, work on past assignments, or help a classmate.

**Leaving early will put you behind and set a poor presidence. Have you ever left your job early because you "didn't have anything else to do"? How did that go?

---

# [fit] Why is attendance
# [fit] so important?

---

# [fit] If you miss a day,
# [fit] you miss a week

We will cover a heavy amount of concepts in one day. If this was easy, everyone would do it!

Attendance is mandatory **throughout the class**.

---

# [fit] It looks good
# [fit] on your resume

Employers often reach out to the school and instructors for reference when hiring a graduate. They will want to know grades and attendance rate to gauge if you'd be a reliable candidate.

---

# [fit] It helps you stay
# [fit] happy and connected

If you're in the classroom, you can participate more easily. You're here with TAs, instructors, and fellow classmates who can help with technical issues, camaraderie, and accountability!

---

# [fit] When in doubt,
# [fit] communicate

We understand that life happens sometimes. As soon as you know you'll be late or absent, notify your instructor. We will work with you, but we need you to reach out to us!

---

# [fit] Radio silence is
# [fit] bad for everyone

If you miss class for **3 days in a row with no communication**, you will be automatically dropped.

# [fit] Grades

---

# Grades

### Have a COMPLETE on *each and every assignment/project*, including final projects, by the final day of class.

All assignments and projects are graded on a **COMPLETE** vs. **INCOMPLETE** basis.

In other words: Either it works the way it's supposed to, or it doesn't!

---

# [fit] Incomplete -> Complete

The assignments and projects are meant to challenge you. A grade of Complete means you have demonstrated understanding of the concept and executed skills effectively.

  * **Complete**: Nice!
  * **Incomplete**: Learn from the feedback, improve, and *RESUBMIT* for your Complete grade!

This is a skill-based program.
Your mission is to develop those skills!

# [fit] Believe in Yourself

---

> Believe in yourself. Don’t believe that little voice in your head that tells you it’s too hard, you won’t ever get this. It’s a lie. All coding is just simple things built into more complex things. If you are not getting something, try to break it down into simple terms, and build from there.
-- Ashley R., WDI Graduate

---

# [fit] Face Your Fears

---

# In a classroom, there's no such thing as a stupid question.

We are all here to learn. Ask questions, and lots of them! Chances are the person next to you is wondering the same thing. If you have too many questions, write them down and check with your instructor or fellow students later.

---

# Do the Work

- **Read everything forever**
  - Error messages. (Yes, really! Every line.)
  - Read assignment requirements carefully. (If you get an incomplete, it's because you didn't read and do every bullet point)
- **Look it up**
  - Slam some words into Google. Skim results for familiar terms or problems that seem similar to yours. The goal is to make you an independent learner.

---

# [fit] Find the Fun

---

- Take every opportunity to **play** with what you learn
- When you're experimenting, you don't have to make it
  do something *useful*. You just have to make it do
  something on purpose!
- Look out for projects and ideas that appeal to you
- Take breaks when you get stuck:
  - Go for a walk
  - Read a book
  - Step away from the screen!

# [fit] Preparation
# [fit] Checklist

---

# Are you set up in Canvas?

Make sure you are signed into Canvas and in the new course for this class... this will be different than the prework course. You should have received an invite by email in the last week.

Canvas will be where you find your lecture files and submit assignments. You will need to have lecture files up during class to ensure you are following material.

You can download these PDF files too!

---

## Have you downloaded the Slack app?

It is required that you are signed into Slack daily. This is how we will communicate with you regarding academics, attendance, days closed and anything pertaining to class.

**Download the Slack app on your desktop**. It's free, and we recommend installing it on your phone as well. You don't want to miss out on shared resources (and hilarious gifs)!

---

## Slack setup

Go ahead and set your profile photo and name so we can all get to know one another better! Since you are on Slack you now have access to our entire alumni and instructor network. Many graduates are still active and are happy to help answer questions.

Keep your eye on are the **#questions** channel, too, for additional help, feel free to ask away. You can Direct Message anyone as well.

---

## Are you familiar with your machine?

Make sure you understand your laptop properly. You don't want to fall behind because you are not sure where to access files, apps or your command line.

---

## Mac (OS X) Users

The majority of our students and instructors use OS X devices (Macbooks). If you are new to this system we recommend to make an appointment with the Apple Genius Bar to learn how to navigate effectively.

---

## Windows and Linux Users

If you are working in Windows or Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, et al.) please be aware our instructors may or may not be familar with this system. We recommend you join the **#windows-support-group** or **#linux-support-group** on Slack.
