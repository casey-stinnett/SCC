# Project: Portfolio Website

Your next assignment is to build a portfolio site for yourself using all that we've learned. Start by mocking things up with a pen and paper or a graphics program before you start coding - submit this as well.

It should have the following features:

- At least 3 separate pages. For example: Home, About, Contact

- Your home page should have a hero image with 3 blocks under it (like [arka.com](https://www.arka.com/) && [meteor.com](https://www.meteor.com/))*

- Uses CSS layout principles we've learned including adding a gutter to the left and right of the page

- Includes photographs. You can find some good resources for images [here](http://nycda.com/blog/8-places-to-find-free-high-definition-images-for-your-website/?utm_source=assignments&utm_medium=curriculum&utm_campaign=portfolio).

- Has links to external websites that open in a new window. Because this is your portfolio, the links should be to something about you, like your social networks.
- Incorporates a `<ul>` and `<nav>` powered navigation bar

Make it look good! If you're confused about how to achieve a certain effect, use a developer's best friend: Google + StackOverflow!

Be proud of the work you do, because you did it!
